   * auto-matching or batch/manual assignment). Required input: deposit ID,
   * acting admin ID, matched customer, matched_at time, method ('AUTOMATIC'
   * or 'MANUAL'), and an audit reason.
   *
   * Validations require that only one matching can be active per deposit,
   * requisite permissions are checked, and business rules for match status
   * progression are enforced. System notifications or downstream workflow
   * triggers (such as error resolution) may occur as side effects. All events
   * are captured for audit compliance. Linked to dashboard, error review, and
   * matching status presentation.
   *
   * Related endpoints: updating, deleting, and querying individual matchings,
   * error linkage, and aggregation for dashboard KPIs.
   *
   * @param body Fields for new matching event log.
