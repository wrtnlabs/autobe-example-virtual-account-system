   * Create a new notification event (virtual_account_notifications) for

   * Creates a new notification event in the 'virtual_account_notifications'
   * table. Typically used by backend notification processors (upon deposit
   * events, expiration, failed payments, etc) or by admin panel to forcibly
   * trigger manual/customer notifications. Required fields:
   * notification_template_id, notification_channel_id, recipient_id,
   * event_type, status, requested_at; sent_at/delivered_at are later filled
   * in by async processes or admin overrides.
   *
   * Strict validation ensures each field is correct; RBAC controls limit who
   * may create notifications (manual triggers may be restricted to admin
   * roles). Duplicate/invalid data (nonexistent template/channel/recipient)
   * must be handled as per conventions. Upon success, the full event object
   * is returned, suitable for log display/audit needs.

   * Fetches a paginated, searchable list of all notification event entries as

   * user/customer/admin notification, or automated system
   * warning/expiration/incident (such as DEPOSIT_CONFIRMED, DEPOSIT_FAIL,

   * endpoint to review outgoing notification performance, troubleshoot
   * failures/non-delivery, and support user/customer service needs.
   *
   * RBAC control ensures only appropriate roles may access notification logs,
   * with special attention to customer privacy and delivery details. The
   * result set may be cross-referenced with channels/templates endpoints for
   * UI presentation. Pagination and performance safeguards are recommended
   * for production use.
