   * Create (insert) a new virtual_account_deposits event record (manual

   * deposit event record manually. The new deposit represents an incoming
   * transfer to a virtual account, containing required fields like the linked
   * virtual account, amount received, depositor name, deposited_at datetime,
   * bank reference number, and initial status ('PENDING', 'MATCHED', etc).
   *
   * Business validations include prevention of duplicate reference numbers
   * for a given virtual account, positive amount checks, and permission
   * requirements for manual event creation. Related actions (auto-matching,
   * notification triggers) may be performed after record creation. Full
   * creation events are captured in the audit log with user and event
   * detail.
   *
   * This endpoint is used only in special flows such as manual corrections,
   * integration testing, or deposit reconciliation workflows when normal
   * automated integration is interrupted. Related endpoints include searching
   * deposit events, matching, error record review, and activity log
   * examination.

  /**
   * Filter, search, and paginate virtual_account_deposits (deposit events).
   *
   * This operation provides a sophisticated search for deposit event records
   * registered in the system. Records in 'virtual_account_deposits' represent
   * all incoming transfers to virtual accounts, with metadata such as account
   * ID, amount, depositor name, timestamp, reference number, and processing
   * status.
   *
   * The dashboard/search request can include numerous criteria: specific
   * account, customer, date range, deposit status (e.g. PENDING, MATCHED,
   * ERROR), reference number, amount range, and more, as well as pagination
   * parameters (page/size) and advanced sorting. Access is restricted to
   * authorized users—typically admins with finance or support roles.
   * Responses are paginated result lists with accompanying metadata for
   * further filtering or Excel export.
   *
   * This operation is linked to matching review, error investigation, and
   * batch reconciliation workflows, as well as notification/alert triggers
   * for deposit processing states. Business rules and validation are applied
   * to all search criteria, and error responses are returned for invalid
   * queries or permission faults.
