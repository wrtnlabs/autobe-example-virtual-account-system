   * Create a new Admin dashboard settings record

   * record for a specific administrator. The payload includes the target
   * admin UUID and a validated JSON settings blob, which encodes preferences
   * like default filters, column selections, and notification rules. The
   * system sets creation and update timestamps atomically in the database.
   *
   * Validation: Only one dashboard settings record per admin should exist
   * (see unique constraint in Prisma schema); attempts to create duplicates
   * must return a 409 error. Only users with the correct privilege may create
   * or initialize dashboard settings.
   *
   * Audit requirements include logging who performed the creation, linking
   * the record to the admin, and ensuring that no sensitive or
   * system-internal config is injectible from the client. Errors are returned
   * if invalid admin IDs or malformed JSON are provided.
   *
   * All fields correspond to those described in the Prisma schema for
   * 'virtual_account_dashboard_settings'.

  /**
   * List and filter all Admin dashboard settings

   *
   * This endpoint supports listing and filtering all administrative dashboard
   * settings entries in the virtual account system. It directly queries the
   * `virtual_account_dashboard_settings` table, as described in the Prisma
   * schema, which contains JSON settings, timestamps, and the associated
   * admin. Access control and filtering should be enforced so only permitted
   * roles can search, and fields such as filter state, preferred columns, and
   * notification preferences are returned as part of the "settings_json"
   * field.
   *
   * Security considerations: Only admins or super-admins with dashboard
   * management permissions should access this endpoint. Returned data should
   * not leak sensitive configuration elements. Input validation must allow
   * filtering by admin, by creation/update date ranges, and enable full
   * pagination and sorting (for export/history auditing use-cases).
   *
   * Examples of business logic include returning only settings for active
   * admins, restricting deleted or test accounts, and ensuring the settings
   * reflect real dashboard use.
   *
   * This operation also provides tracing for when settings were last updated,
   * referencing `created_at` and `updated_at` as indexed in the schema. Error
   * handling should provide consistent pagination errors and filter
   * validation messages as per OpenAPI best practices.
