   * Prisma schema: name, code, logo_url (optional), and other audit data as
   * per business rules.
   *
   * Uniqueness of bank code is enforced, as are field lengths and data
   * validation. If a bank entry with the same code already exists, an error
   * (409) is returned. Successful inserts are audit-logged.

   *
   * This operation retrieves a paginated list of banks available for virtual

   * consistent with REST API best practices. The entity
   * (virtual_account_banks table) manages the master registry of banks, as
   * explained in the Prisma schema.

   * The request body can specify search criteria such as name, code, and sort
   * order. The logic supports administrator dashboard use cases for managing,

   * may access this endpoint. All access and filter actions are audit-logged
   * for compliance.
   *
   * Related endpoints are POST (add new bank), GET (detail), PUT (update),
   * and DELETE (remove) for the same entity. Business logic: banks in use by
   * active virtual accounts may not be deleted (referential integrity
   * enforced).
   *
   * @param body Optional filters, sort order, and paging config for the bank
   *   list.
