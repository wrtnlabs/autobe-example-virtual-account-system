   * requirements for notification delivery attempts (see ERD and

   * roles with notification log management permissions.

   * primary key. Deletion is permanent and does not cascade to the parent
   * notification event or template. If the entry does not exist, a 404 must
   * be returned. All deletion requests should be logged in the admin activity
   * log for traceability. Any unauthorized or failed attempt should return a
   * 403 or 500 error as appropriate.

   * 204), and all attempts are audited for compliance. Related to endpoints
