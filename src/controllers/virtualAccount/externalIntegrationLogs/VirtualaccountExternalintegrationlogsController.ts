   * Create a new external integration event log

   *
   * This endpoint lets automated services, worker jobs, or authorized admins
   * log new integration events as they occur—such as a sync to ERP, a webhook
   * to Mall/PG, or a push to an external bank API. Each log records the
   * target system, event type, request/response bodies, result
   * (success/failure), error, and timestamps. Only meta (no secrets) are
   * stored in request/response.
   *
   * Security: Auth is enforced; only system/automation users or properly
   * privileged admins can insert logs. All business validations check
   * referenced system's existence (by UUID), controlled event_type, and
   * correct JSON formatting/limits. Operation is fully auditable and
   * referenced by troubleshooting tools. Duplicates or
   * inconsistent/incomplete postings result in HTTP errors.
   *
   * Returns newly created log row. Errors thrown for invalid system, payload,
   * privilege, or unexpected faults (400/401/403/500).
   *
   * @param body Data describing the new integration event log.

  /**
   * List or search external integration logs with filters/pagination
   * (virtual_account_external_integration_logs).
   *
   * This endpoint lets administrators retrieve a filtered and paginated list
   * of external integration log events—each entry records API call events or
   * data exchanges with external systems. The operation supports search by
   * external_system_id, event_type, success/fail, and date range, with
   * pagination (page/size) and sorted descent by time.
   *
   * Uses request body for complex search conditions, as filtering involves
   * non-trivial logic. Returned data includes integration event details
   * (event_type, request and response payload, success flag, error, and
   * timestamp) but omits sensitive data/secrets. Useful for troubleshooting,
   * system audit, and compliance analysis. Security is based on RBAC roles
   * defined in the requirements; only admins with appropriate privileges can
   * view logs.
   *
   * Errors are returned for failed permission (403), invalid filters (400),
   * or server/database issues (500).
