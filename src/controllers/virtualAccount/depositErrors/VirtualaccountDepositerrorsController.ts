   *
   * Creates a new deposit error entry in the 'virtual_account_deposit_errors'
   * table, supporting atomic logging of errors encountered during virtual
   * account deposit handling. The endpoint requires fields such as
   * deposit_id, error_code, error_message, optionally admin_id, error_detail,
   * and the occurred_at timestamp.
   *
   * This operation is invoked by either system-level jobs (auto-matching,
   * parsing, webhook handling) or by authorized admin actions (manual error
   * registration, overrides). Permissions are tightly controlled: manual
   * creation may require additional RBAC checks to prevent misuse or
   * accidental logging.
   *
   * Upon success, the endpoint returns the detailed object as persisted.
   * Business logic may reject duplicates, validate correctness of the target
   * deposit record, or throttle flood attempts. Errors must be handled
   * according to standard conventions (422 for validation, 409 for duplicate,
   * 403/401 for unauthorized).

  /**
   * List and search deposit errors (virtual_account_deposit_errors table)
   * with filtering, pagination, and security enforcement.
   *
   * This API endpoint retrieves a paginated and searchable list of deposit
   * error events, directly referencing the 'virtual_account_deposit_errors'
   * table. Each deposit error record tracks failed or exceptional cases
   * encountered during virtual account deposits, including attributes such as
   * error_code, error_message, deposit_id, admin_id, and occurred_at. The API
   * supports advanced search parameters, including filtering by error code,
   * admin, timeframe, and keyword in error messages, as well as pagination
   * and sorting for scalable review of large event volumes.
   *
   * Administrators typically use this endpoint for error analysis, operations
   * troubleshooting, or proactive incident management. Data access must honor
   * RBAC permission rules, ensuring sensitive events are only viewable by
   * authorized accounts. Particular care must be taken to hide potentially
   * sensitive detail fields unless necessary for diagnosis, and to prevent
   * information leakage in export/download workflows.
   *
   * Related operations include retrieval of individual errors (GET by id),
   * the deposit list for the affected virtual account or deposit event, and
   * contextual linking within admin dashboard integrations. All query
   * parameters are validated for security and performance.
