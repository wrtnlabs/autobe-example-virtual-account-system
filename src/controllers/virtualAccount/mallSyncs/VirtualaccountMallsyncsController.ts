   * Cafe24, 고도몰). The operation is essential for end-to-end tracing of all

   * (referencing the mall), order_id, the payload sent, and expected result.
   * All requests are strictly permission-checked (RBAC enforced) and
   * validated for field consistency. The new entity and its metadata are
   * returned for further processing/display. This endpoint supports the
   * reporting, notification, and troubleshooting requirements outlined in
   * integration documentation and admin dashboard features.

   * Flexible search options include order ID, target mall, status, and time
