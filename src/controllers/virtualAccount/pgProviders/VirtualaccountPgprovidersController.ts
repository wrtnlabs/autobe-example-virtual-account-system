   * `virtual_account_pg_providers` table. All input is strictly validated:
   * required fields such as `name`, `code`, and `api_endpoint` must be
   * supplied and must be unique. Upon success, a record will be created, and
   * the new provider will be available for virtual account issuance
   * workflows.
   *
   * Security is enforced using RBAC; only privileged admins may use this
   * endpoint. Input is checked for uniqueness to prevent duplication of
   * providers or conflicting codes. The operation will fail if uniqueness is
   * violated (409 error).
   *
   * Data validation ensures only atomic, non-derived values are inserted,
   * maintaining strict 3NF normalization. Business logic ensures integration
   * metadata is correct before creation.
   *
   * Related endpoints for fetching, updating, and deleting providers are also
   * available.

   * @param body Data for the new PG provider (name, code, API endpoint, etc).

   *
   * This API fetches a single record from the `virtual_account_pg_providers`
   * table using a unique PG provider ID. The endpoint allows administrators
   * to view the provider's details, such as its name, code, API endpoint, and
   * status. All returned data is atomic and complies with 3NF; the response
   * never includes summarizations or duplicate data. This read operation is
   * essential for various service maintenance and external API integration
   * workflows, where knowing each PG configuration is required.
   *
   * Security is enforced through role-based permissions (RBAC); only
   * authorized administrators can access provider details. The endpoint
   * ensures that only a provider with a matching ID will return a result,
   * otherwise, a 404 not found is returned for absent resources. Links to
   * external integrations are also visible.
   *
   * No business logic modifies the record—this is a pure read operation.
   * Error handling follows typical RESTful conventions (401 for unauthorized,
   * 404 for not found).

   * provider entries.

   * (e.g., name, API endpoint, code) may be updated; unique constraints are
   * enforced (e.g., code uniqueness). The update will only proceed for
