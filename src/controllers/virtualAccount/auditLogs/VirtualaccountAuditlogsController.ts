   * security, compliance, and traceability (see requirements and
   * 07_virtual_account_security.md). The request body must provide all

   * Successful creation returns the created audit log object. Errors
   * (validation, lack of permission) are reported as 422/403. Only authorized

   * Retrieves a list of audit logs from the virtual_account_audit_logs table,

   * audit, compliance, and dashboard analysis.
   *
   * The endpoint accepts a JSON request body specifying filter criteria:
   * actor ID/type, event type, date ranges, target type, and keyword search.
   * Paginated response includes relevant logs (with actor, event, target,
   * timestamp, and description). Access restricted to authorized
   * admin/compliance roles. Results may be sorted by date or event type. All
   * access to this endpoint is itself audited.
   *
   * The response is a page of audit logs with pagination metadata. 403
   * returned for unauthorized access. 422 for invalid filter parameters.
   * Related endpoints: GET/PUT/DELETE single log, and PATCH with different
