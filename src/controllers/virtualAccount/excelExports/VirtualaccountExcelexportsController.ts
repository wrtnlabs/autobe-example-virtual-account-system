   * Security: Only privileged roles (e.g., superadmin or export-managers)

   * Request and response structure aligns fully with OpenAPI, referencing the
   * schema's field docs for filterability, traceability, and normalization.
   * Hard errors (e.g., invalid filters) return validation errors. Intended
   * for use in export activity audit pages and support.
