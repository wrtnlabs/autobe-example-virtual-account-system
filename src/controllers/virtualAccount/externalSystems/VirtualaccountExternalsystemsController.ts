   * Register a new external system configuration for integration

   * integrations (such as an ERP, e-commerce platform, bank, or payment
   * gateway) into the platform. All required fields—system_type (one of: ERP,
   * MALL, BANK, PG), name, api_base_url, enabled (boolean), and initial
   * timestamp—must be provided. Business rules are applied for
   * system_type/name uniqueness (see @@unique([system_type, name]) in
   * schema), and URLs/config are validated for correctness.
   *
   * Security is enforced (admin/super_admin role only), and the operation is
   * fully audited (triggers creation event in both audit and admin logs).
   * Validation ensures no duplicate system registration and prevents
   * insertion of incomplete or inconsistent data. Related logs and future
   * integration event logs reference this newly created system by ID.
   *
   * API returns the created external system row (excluding any sensitive
   * keys/secrets). Returns HTTP errors for validation failures, duplicates,
   * permission errors, or unexpected issues (400, 409, 401/403, 500,
   * respectively).
   *
   * @param body Details for the new external system to register.

   * API base URL, enabled status, and timestamps for creation and last

   * editing, enabling/disabling, or deleting the system record.
