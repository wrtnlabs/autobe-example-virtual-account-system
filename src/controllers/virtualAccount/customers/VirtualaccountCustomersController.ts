  /**
   * List virtual account customers with filtering and pagination
   * (virtual_account_customers table).
   *
   * This endpoint is designed to fetch a paginated and searchable list of
   * customers who are registered in the virtual account system. It references
   * the 'virtual_account_customers' table, which stores key customer
   * information such as name, phone, email, and registration timestamp, as
   * detailed in the Prisma schema.
   *
   * The endpoint supports advanced filtering by customer name, phone number,
   * email, registration period, and deletion state. Pagination and sorting
   * options are provided to enhance admin dashboard usability and facilitate
   * Excel export features, fulfilling dashboard and reporting use-cases.
   *
   * Access to this endpoint is typically restricted to administrator users or
   * higher, as enforced by RBAC and API authentication mechanisms
   * (OAuth2/HMAC). All queries are logged for audit trail, and returned data
   * never includes deleted records unless specifically requested by filter.
   *
   * Validation rules include: string filter fields must be valid, dates in
   * ISO, and filters do not expose physical deletion timestamps. Error
   * handling is robust, responding with well-formed error objects for
   * permission or validation failures.
   *
   * Related API operations include: GET /virtualAccount/customers/{id} for
   * detail, POST /virtualAccount/customers for creation, and PUT/DELETE for
   * update/removal.
   *
   * Returned data is always anonymized where required for compliance, and
   * response includes a total count for UI pagination controls. This endpoint
   * underpins the main customer search view in the admin console.
   *
   * @param body Query parameters for filtering, searching, and pagination
   *   when listing virtual account customers.
