   * Create a new admin activity log entry

   * This operation logs a single admin action, such as an Excel export,
   * permission or role change, notification policy update, dashboard settings
   * change, or other sensitive/critical admin event. The input must provide
   * all atomic fields: action type, affected entity, optional target entity
   * ID, result, IP address, meta/context JSON, and timestamp. The operation
   * assigns the originated admin (actor) and writes a normalized log row.
   *
   * Only system-internal or privileged user agents should invoke this API
   * directly (it is usually called by backend services during admin
   * operations). Success returns the stored log record; errors return
   * validation (422), RBAC (403), or system (500) codes. All fields are
   * validated and RBAC is enforced as in requirements.
   *
   * Should be used together with PATCH/GET/PUT/DELETE for a full audit trail
   * lifecycle.

   *
   * This operation enables authorized admin users to search the full activity
   * log, filtering by actor, event type, date/time, target entity, result, or
   * free-text search on the meta JSON/context fields. Typical use cases
   * include forensic investigations, export for audit reporting, or tracking

   * operations, etc).
   *
   * The request body must specify search criteria (actor, type, entity,

   * themselves logged for compliance.
   *
   * Returns: A paginated list of activity log records. Errors are produced on
   * invalid queries or permission problems.
   *
   * Related APIs: Use POST for new activity, GET for details, PUT for update.
   * For Excel export, a different API should be used.
