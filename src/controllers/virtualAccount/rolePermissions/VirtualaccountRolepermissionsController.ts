   * documentation. This mapping enables the specified role to get the
   * corresponding permission, supporting fine-grained security management.
   *
   * Payload includes role_id and permission_id, which must reference valid
   * existing roles and permissions. Creation fails if the mapping already
   * exists (enforced at DB via unique constraint), or if either
   * role/permission does not exist. All creation attempts, successful or
   * failed, are audit-logged for compliance with RBAC management
   * requirements.
   *
   * Validation: request is rejected with 422 if IDs are missing/invalid. DB
   * errors (constraint violations) are reported with structured error
   * responses. Only admins/superadmins may execute this operation.

   * Security: This endpoint is intended for admin or super admin use,
   * enforced by RBAC middleware. The results are never cached and may include
   * sensitive security configuration info, so access is tightly controlled.
   *
   * Validation and errors: Invalid search requests return 422. Users without
   * RBAC VIEW/EDIT privileges will get 403. Response includes a paginated
