   * Get details of a single virtual_account_materialized_stats record by ID.

   *
   * This endpoint provides direct access to the denormalized, materialized
   * stat snapshot row in the database. It is primarily used for dashboard
   * analytics, admin audits, or system health checks by referencing the stat
   * ID from performance charts, alerts, or reporting drilldowns. This ensures
   * that details of the stat, such as the metric key (e.g.,
   * 'active_accounts', 'fail_deposit_count'), value, and snapshot timestamp,
   * can be reviewed or verified directly by administrators.
   *

   * allowed access; sensitive or performance stats may require additional
   * security controls. If the stat ID does not exist or has expired/been
   * purged, a 404 Not Found error will be returned. Referenced by admin
   * dashboard for stat drill-downs; no modification of the stat occurs with
   * this endpoint.
