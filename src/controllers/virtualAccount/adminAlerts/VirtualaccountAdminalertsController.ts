   * Create a new admin alert (virtual_account_admin_alerts table).
   *
   * This API operation creates a new admin alert record, typically from
   * backend monitoring or detection logic. Examples include mass mismatch
   * detection, external API failures, or security/scaling warnings. The alert
   * will be associated with a specific admin if targeted, or left open/global
   * otherwise. The alert type (such as 'MASS_MISMATCH' or 'SECURITY_WARNING')
   * must be provided, as well as contextual detail in JSON format—this might
   * include involved virtual account IDs, error payloads, or anomaly
   * metrics.
   *
   * The notified_at timestamp records when the alert was generated. The
   * clearable flag controls whether the UI allows an admin to mark this alert
   * as resolved. Alerts are not auto-deleted—clearing status is tracked
   * separately via the cleared_at field.
   *
   * Permissions: Only users with proper admin or super admin role (see RBAC
   * requirements) may invoke this endpoint. All insertions are tracked in the
   * admin activity log. Validation includes schema and actor authentication.
   *
   * On success, returns the full admin alert record. On conflict or error,
   * standardized error responses (422, 403, 409, 500) with details are
   * produced.

   * This patch operation allows the client (typically an admin or super

   * the admin activity log for compliance. Input validation ensures
   * compliance with schema and business rules.
