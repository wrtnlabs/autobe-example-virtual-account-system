   *
   * This endpoint deletes a specific system configuration record from
   * 'virtual_account_system_settings'.
   *
   * The primary purpose is to allow administrators to remove obsolete,
   * revoked, or incorrect system settings. It enforces strict privilege
   * requirements—only system, infra, or security admins can call this API.
   * Deletion is tracked in audit logs as per security policy requirements in
   * the requirements reports (see 권한·감사·보안).
   *
   * Relationally, this operates exclusively on the configuration row
   * identified by 'id' PK in the table. There are no cascading deletes to
   * other entities—child references (if any) are not deleted. Business logic
   * ensures non-recoverable operations are logged. Deletion requests are
   * verified for orphan creation (should not break config dependencies).
   *
   * If an invalid/nonexistent ID is provided, the API returns 404. If
   * deleted, no further queries for this 'id' should succeed. On error, a
   * permission or internal error code is returned as specified in the OpenAPI
   * standard for this service domain.
   *
   * @param id Primary key ID of the system settings record to delete.
